🧮 Scientific Calculator in C

A menu-driven scientific calculator implemented in C language.
This project demonstrates modular programming, use of functions, switch-case control, and integration of math.h library functions.


🚀 Features

🔢 Basic Operations

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus


📋 Other Functions

Multiplication Table

Factorial (Recursive)

Fibonacci Series


📐 Unit Conversions

Time


🧠 Mathematical Functions

Power functions (Square, Cube, nth power, etc.)

Root functions (Square root, Cube root, Hypotenuse, etc.)

Exponential & Logarithmic functions

Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.)

Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.)
